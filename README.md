# ANN_LOYALTY_SCORE with Keras Regresor
The ANN_Try.ipynb project makes use of a customer loyalty dataset of 10 features and 1000 observations.
It details various preprocessing functionalities (Dealing with null values, outliers, One-Hot Encoding etc).
It implements a model that makes use of the Keras Regressor on an Artificial  Neural Network to train  and test the prediction of customer loyalty score.
