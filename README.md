# ANN_LOYALTY_SCORE with Keras Regresor
The ANN_Try.ipynb project uses a customer loyalty dataset of 10 features and 1000 observations.
It details various preprocessing functionalities (Dealing with null values, outliers, and  One-Hot Encoding).
It implements a model that uses the Keras Regressor on an Artificial  Neural Network to train  and test the prediction of customer loyalty scores while rating feature importance.
